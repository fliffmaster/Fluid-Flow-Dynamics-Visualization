* Preface
  Fluid Fluid Dynamics Visualization is a particle filtration reactor
  simulator. This document describes the operations which can be
  performed in Fluid Flow Dynamics Visualization.
* Introduction
  Fluid Flow Dynamics Visualization allows you to simulate three
  different kinds of reactors; [[batch_reactor][batch reactor]], [[constantly_stirred_reactor][constantly stirred
  reactor]], and [[plug_flow_reactor][plug flow reactor]]. 
* Installation  
 You can run Fluid Flow Dynamics Visualization by running
 FluidFlowApplet.jar as an executable, in the command line, or in a
 Java capable browser. To run as an executable, you should be running
 [[http://www.java.com][Javaâ„¢]] version 6 or higher. To run in the command line, type
 #+begin_example
   java -jar FluidFlowApplet.jar
 #+end_example
 To run in a web browser, the browser must have Java and JavaScript
 capable browser such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, or
 Safari. If the browser is JavaScript enabled but does not have Java,
 the applet will give you a link to the Oracle download page.
* Controls
  Each reactor can be accessed by clicking on their respective
  tabs. Each reactor page allows you to start, stop, and reset the
  reactor simulation. The reset button, will set the reactor state to
  the starting state with the user set parameters given in the entry
  fields. Clicking reset while the reactor is running will cause the
  simulation to restart. The simulations will continue running until
  you click the stop button or close the program.
* Batch Reactor
#<<batch_reactor>>
   [[file:Batch.png]] 

   A batch reactor operates by putting a solution into the reactor,
   sealing it, and then allowing the reactor to filter the solution
   before removing the contents. Fluid Flow Dynamics Visualization
   allows you to simulate the change in particle that occurs in a
   batch reactor. The user can specify the initial concentration and
   reaction constant.  See the [[batch_reactor_dynamics][Appendix]] for a description of the
   algorithms used in simulation.

   The concentration per cycle is shown in the Batch Data dialog. The
   Batch Visualization dialog gives a pictographic representation of
   the change in particulate concentration. The change in particle
   concentration is shown visually by the density of dots in the
   simulation. The Current Concentration and the Percentage of Inflow
   Concentration, which is the current concentration divided by the
   initial concentration, are shown in the lower right of the window.

   The initial concentration and reaction constant can be set by
   entering numerical values in their respective fields; "Initial
   Concentration" and "Rate Constant per Minute", and then clicking
   the Apply button.
   
* Constantly Stirred Reactor
#<<constantly_stirred_reactor>>
   [[file:cstr.png]]
   
   A constantly stirred reactor has a holding tank that constantly
   filters its contents with a constant in-flow and out-flow. Fluid
   Flow Dynamics Visualization allows the user to specify the initial
   concentration, reaction constant, and flow rate. See the [[constantly_stirred_reactor_dynamics][Appendix]]
   for a description of the algorithms used in simulation.

   The concentration per cycle is shown in the CSTR Data dialog. The
   CSTR Visualization dialog gives a pictographic representation of
   the change in particulate concentration in the out-flow. The change
   in particle concentration is shown visually by the density of dots
   in the simulation. The Current Concentration and the Percentage of
   Inflow Concentration, which is the current concentration divided by
   the initial concentration, are shown in the lower right of the
   window.

   The initial concentration, reaction constant, and flow rate can be
   set by entering numerical values in their respective fields;
   "Initial Concentration", "Rate Constant per Minute", and "Inflow
   Rate", and then clicking the Apply button.
* Plug Flow Reactor
#<<plug_flow_reactor>>
   [[file:pfr.png]]

   A plug flow reactor operates by having a constant in-flow and
   out-flow through a filtration tube. Fluid Flow Dynamics
   Visualization allows the user to specify the initial concentration,
   reaction constant, and flow rate.  See the [[plug_flow_reactor_dynamics][Appendix]] for a
   description of the algorithms used in simulation.

   The change in particulate concentration is shown with the in-flow
   on the left and out-flow on the right. The flow is shown by wight
   and gray bands. The change in particle concentration is shown
   visually by the density of dots in the simulation. The Current
   Concentration and the Percentage of Outflow Concentration are shown
   in the lower right of the window.  The Current Concentration is the
   concentration in the out-flow. Percentage of Outflow Concentration
   is the current concentration divided by the initial concentration.

   The initial concentration and reaction constant can be set by
   entering numerical values in their respective fields; "Initial
   Concentration" and "Rate Constant per Minute", and then clicking
   the Apply button. The flow rate can be changed dynamically by using
   the "Flow Rate" slider. Move the slider left to increase the flow
   rate and right to decrease. The "Toggle Flow" button will stop and
   start the in-flow, but the contents within the rector will continue
   to flow.

** Batch Reactor Dynamics
#<<batch_reactor_dynamics>>
   The dynamics of the batch reactor is described by the
   equation \[C=C_0e^{-kt},\] where $C_0$ is the initial
   concentration, $k$ is the reaction constant, $t$ is time, and $C$
   is the current concentration. Time is automatically set initially
   to 0 and is incremented by 1 for each cycle in the simulation.
** Constantly Stirred Reactor Dynamics
#<<constantly_stirred_reactor_dynamics>>
   The constantly stirred reactor is simulated in discrete increments
   by taking a weighted average between the reactor contents and the
   in-flow contents \[C'=C_{\hbox{tank}}(1-P)+C_{\hbox{in}}P\] and
   then subtracting the amount concentration removed by the
   reactor \[C=C'-kC',\] where $C_{\hbox{tank}}$ is the concentration
   in the tank, $P$ is the percent volume of the reactor solution
   being replaced, $C_{\hbox{in}}$ is the in-flow concentration, $k$
   is the reaction constant, and $C$ is the resulting concentration in
   the tank. Time is automatically set initially to 0 and is
   incremented by 1 for each cycle in the simulation.
** Plug Flow Reactor Dynamics
#<<plug_flow_reactor_dynamics>>
   The plug flow reactor is simulated by partitioning the filtration
   tube into a series of batch reactors. Each batch reactor controls
   its own state and visual output. The plug flow reactor changes the
   location of the batch reactors to simulate the change in
   concentration with distance traveled by the solution. When a batch
   reactor exits the plug flow reactor, the concentration of the batch
   reactor is recorded as the current concentration, and the batch
   reactor is destroyed. New batch reactors are created at the start
   of the plug flow reactor.
